# Hubitat Driver for Elgato Key Light

This is a simple driver for Elgato Key Light.

## Installation

* Import raw driver code from [Elgato-Key-Light.groovy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktriponis/Hubitat-Elgato-Key-Light/main/Elgato-Key-Light.groovy) file
* Create a new virtual device using the driver
* Specify IP address of the device (might need to check router config)
* Enjoy!

## Capabilities

* Turning the light on/off
* Adjusting light brightness
* Adjusting color temperature in Kelvin

## Alexa Integration

So far seems to work with Alexa, device being recognized as a **light** with capability to set power level and colour (temperature).

## Google Home Integration

Don't have google home device on hand to test, so can't say if it works or not.

## Device Support

* [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)

Note: might work with other devices like **Ring Light** and **Key Light Air**, but since I don't have those, I wasn't able to test it out.
